In my case I use slackware, so the solution was to modify the executable in /usr/share/wayland-sessions/sway.desktop following this directive.

# From sway wiki.

I'm not using logind but still want DBus/PolKit/power management to work.
What can I do?

If you're using ConsoleKit2, launch sway using

exec ck-launch-session dbus-launch --sh-syntax --exit-with-session sway

Alternatively, you could omit the ck-launch-session part.

Thx. google traductor.
